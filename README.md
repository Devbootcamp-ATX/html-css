```
15 mins - Intros and Icebreaker
15 mins - Overview
20 minutes - HTML 101
20 minutes - CSS 101
```

### Icebreaker

Option A - Quirks
- Everyone goes around the room and answers the following:
- What is a quirk about them?
- Where are they from?
- Why are they here?

Option B - Ball Game

- First person has a ball, says their name then tosses the ball to someone else. That person then says thank you "name", then say their name and repeat until everyone has said their name and touched the ball.
- redo in same order
- redo without thank you and just names
- redo with no names and cut time in half
- redo cut time in half again and aim to get under 6 seconds for group of 20

### Notes for Presenter

- When presenting, press 's' on the keyboard to show speaker notes (for questions, asides, etc).

- Make sure to show how to use each tool when going over the tool section (especially the console).

- Get to the breakouts as fast as possible, and constantly bring up the console and sublime to showcase concepts. Students learn best when they're the ones typing or seeing live coding, and not just listening to us lecture.

- add ?print-pdf to print slides to PDF. (e.g. index.html?print-pdf#/)
